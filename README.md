This is a sample app using [TermKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza) that 
pretends to be TurboSwift for Unix systems.

Currently it does not do much, it is full of bugs, but it is useful to try
and explore my TermKit UI toolkit.

If you want to try this, the challenge is htat I have hardcoded two paths:
one for the project, and one for the first file loaded, which are both
loaded when you use the File/Open Std Project, and then File/Open Std file,
those two right now are hardcoed to launch the Swift Language server,
so you might need to both edit the paths, and also, make sure to activate
those two menu options in order.

Anything else is not really working
